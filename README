DESCRIPTION
Opensource part of YES Erlang Scheduler.
The reason behind spawning third repository for the same project
is prosaic â€” I'll do massive refactoring of the code and project
structire so that keeping the history of the source codes would
be rather confusing for the repository viewer. Consider it as a
self-contained properly designed project, and not even dare to 
look at erlduler and otpduler repos, I'll keep them at github 
for the sake of looking at my progress in mastering the proper
Erlang toolchain.

WIP
Now I am adding rebar support for YES.
